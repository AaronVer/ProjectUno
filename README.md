**Days of Redemption equiping sumulator**

**Project Description**

This program is designed to simulate certain mechanics I for the RPG video game I plan to make later in my life - Days of Redemption. I have made
several programs of this nature, with this one serving to emulate the process of creating characters and equipping them with items.

**Technologies Used**

Log4J - version 1.2.17
DBeaver - version 21.3.5
IntelliJ - version 1.0
Postman - version 9.15.2

**Features**


Creating a character template
Assigning equipment into the the equipment slots for character (equipment items must be made in SQL currently)

To-do list:
1. Creating equipment items using the program itself.
2. 2nd weapon slot and 3 accessory slots.
3. Combining the program with my level up simulator program,
4. Displaying a character's total stats from both the leveling up process and equipment.

**Getting Started**

1. Use "git clone https://github.com/AaronVer/ProjectUno/" to clone it into an inteliJ repository
2. Run program and leave it running in InteliJ
3. Use Postman to interact with "localport:8000" to activate the backends and front ends of the program.
